      Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Davina</strong>, a curious, people-focused problem solver with a growing passion for data. 
      After years of working in fast-paced customer service and operations roles (most recently at Enterprise Truck Rental), 
      I‚Äôve learned how to thrive under pressure, keep things running smoothly, and turn challenges into solutions. 
      Now I‚Äôm channeling those skills into the world of <strong>data analytics</strong>.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      I‚Äôm currently completing the <strong>Google Data Analytics Certificate</strong> through Merit America, 
      where I‚Äôm gaining hands-on experience with tools like <strong>Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R</strong>. 
      I enjoy digging into messy data, spotting patterns, and telling stories with insights that drive better decisions.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      With a degree from <strong>California State University, San Bernardino</strong> and a reputation for being adaptable, 
      collaborative, and always willing to learn, I‚Äôm excited to grow in this field and contribute to 
      data-driven teams that value curiosity and heart.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      Let‚Äôs connect. I‚Äôm always open to feedback, collaboration and good conversation.
    </p>
