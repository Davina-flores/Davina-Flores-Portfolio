      Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Davina</strong>, a curious, people-focused problem solver with a growing passion for data. 
      After years of working in fast-paced customer service and operations roles (most recently at Enterprise Truck Rental), 
      Iâ€™ve learned how to thrive under pressure, keep things running smoothly, and turn challenges into solutions. 
      Now Iâ€™m channeling those skills into the world of <strong>data analytics</strong>.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      Iâ€™m currently completing the <strong>Google Data Analytics Certificate</strong> through Merit America, 
      where Iâ€™m gaining hands-on experience with tools like <strong>Excel, SQL, Tableau, and R</strong>. 
      I enjoy digging into messy data, spotting patterns, and telling stories with insights that drive better decisions.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      With a degree from <strong>Cal State San Bernardino</strong> and a reputation for being adaptable, 
      collaborative, and always willing to learn, Iâ€™m excited to grow in this field and contribute to 
      data-driven teams that value curiosity and heart.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 1rem;">
      Letâ€™s connect. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, and good coffee â˜•ðŸ“Š
